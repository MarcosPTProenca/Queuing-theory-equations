# Queuing theory equations and distributions generator
 Functions for the queuing theory equations, distributions generator with random numbers and data analysis

In this project I did two codes to help me in the subject Simulação de Sistemas available in Unicamp - BR. The first one called "Equacoes teoria de filas" has a lot of functions to see if the Markov chain is erdodic, to calculate the probability with Poisson distribution, to calculate equations of the queuing models M/M/1/GD/∞/∞, M/M/1/GD/c/∞, M/M/S/GD/∞/∞, M/M/R/GD/K/K. I still want to implement a visual interface for this code, because I think it would be visualized better. The second code that I implemented was "Geracao e tratamento dos dados". This one I made for the final work of the subject and I implemented some distributions, like exponential and triangular with random numbers with numpy, its curves, diagrams and box-plots with matplotlib, I did the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with the distributions I generated to verify if they were generated correctly and at the end I calculted the R² which is a parameter to verify if the data generated follows the distribution chosen.

> ## Built With
